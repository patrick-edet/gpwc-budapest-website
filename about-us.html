                <h3>Who we are</h3>

                <p>
                    Founded by Sam and Helen Harris from Hamilton, 
                    Ontario, Chocolate Charm was the first speciality chocolate shop in the region. 
                    What started out as a hobby fostered by a deep, passionate love of chocolate quickly 
                    turned into a local sensation, with visitors coming from across the region to get a 
                    taste of the Harris' delicious homemade confectionaries. 
                    
                    Sam and Helen have moved their production base from their home kitchen to an ultra-modern
                    chocolate factory, but the home-kitchen attention to detail has remained. Chocolate 
                    Charm now employees more than 20 employees, each and every one of which has a passion
                    for chocolate and takes deep pride in its production. Chocolate Charm products are 
                    available in dozens of retail stores and online.
