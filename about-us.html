                <h3>Who we are</h3>

                <p class="aboutme-text">
                    Our journey began in December 2024, in the heart of Budapest. A small group of believers gathered, united by a simple but powerful desire: to worship God with sincerity, grow in faith together, and share the hope of Jesus with our city. We didn’t have a grand building or large resources, only a vision, prayer, and a deep sense that God was calling us to begin.

                    Those early meetings were filled with warmth, laughter, and heartfelt worship. Every gathering was an opportunity to pray for Budapest, encourage one another, and dream about what God could do through a faithful community. </p><br>

                    <p class="aboutme-text">From the beginning, our heart has been for people from all walks of life - local Hungarians, internationals, students, families, and those seeking a place to belong. Over time, friendships deepened, faith grew stronger, and our services became a refuge for many.

                    Though we are still young, we have already seen God’s faithfulness in remarkable ways: people encountering Christ for the first time, prayers answered, and lives changed. We believe our story is only beginning, and each chapter will be written with the same passion and trust in God that brought us together in that first December.

                    Our mission remains clear: to love God wholeheartedly, love people genuinely, and serve Budapest with compassion. As we look to the future, we carry the same spark of faith that started it all, believing that God has placed us here for such a time as this.
